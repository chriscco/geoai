(FSF-WFM) to compute estimates of the 30-year, climate-adjusted aggregate
wildfire hazard for the contiguous United States at 30 m horizontal resolution is
presented. The FSF-WFM integrates several existing methods from the wildfire
science community and implements computationally efficient and scalable
modeling techniques to allow for new high-resolution, CONUS-wide hazard
generation. Burn probability, flame length, and ember spread for the years 2022
and 2052 are computed from two ten-year representative Monte Carlo simulations
of wildfire behavior, utilizing augmented LANDFIRE fuel estimates updated with all
the available disturbance information. FSF-WFM utilizes ELMFIRE, an
open-source, Rothermel-based wildfire behavior model, and multiple US Federal
Government open data sources to drive the simulations. LANDFIRE non-burnable
fuel classes within the wildland-urban interface (WUI) are replaced with fuel
estimates from machine-learning models, trained on data from historical fires, to
allow the propagation of wildfire through the WUI in the model. Historical wildfire
ignition locations and NOAA’s hourly time series of surface weather at 2.5 km
resolution are used to drive ELMFIRE to produce wildfire hazards representative
of the 2022 and 2052 conditions at 30 m resolution, with the future weather
conditions scaled to the IPCC CMIP5 RCP4.5 model ensemble predictions. Winds
and vegetation were held constant between the 2022 and 2052 simulations, and
climate change’s impacts on the future fuel conditions are the main contributors to
the changes observed in the 2052 results. Non-zero wildfire exposure is estimated
for 71.8 million out of 140 million properties across CONUS. Climate change
impacts add another 11% properties to this non-zero exposure class over the next
30 years, with much of this change observed in the forested areas east of the
Mississippi River. “Major” aggregate wildfire exposure of greater than 6% over the
30-year analysis period from 2022 to 2052 is estimated for 10.2 million properties.
The FSF-WFM represents a notable contribution to the ability to produce
property-specific, climate-adjusted wildfire risk assessments in the US."""
